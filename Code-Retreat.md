[Coderetreat](http://coderetreat.org) is a structured activity designed to help software developers practice improving their skills on the fundamentals of application engineering and testing.

The activity is a facilitated event of a small group of developer participants. The basic structure is something like this:

* Find a partner to pair-program with
* For 45 minutes, attempt to use TDD to implement [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) simulation
* When time's up, delete your code
* Have a brief retrospective as a group
* Find another pair and attempt the problem again (often with a constraint added by the facilitator)
