This wiki presents some notes on testing.

## What?

It's still very much a work-in-progress, so feel free to peruse any pages that interest you. Perhaps the most novel aspect to this repo right now is the discussion of the [[trade-off between regression safety in testing and design|Tests'-Influence-on-Design]]. There will also be a discussion of [[Detroit-school|Detroit-school TDD]] and [[London-school|London-school TDD]] TDD, as that isn't wellÂ articulated on the Internet, as far as I know.

## Why?

This wiki has been a long time coming to help short-circuit conversations about concepts core to software testing that I'm tired of repeating. The first catalyst to actually working on it has been a [[5-day training|5-Day-Training-Agenda]] event. In the fall of 2015, it'll support the development of [this talk](https://gist.github.com/searls/19f34ef932124702cfa1) at a handful of conferences across the US.

## Caveats

Because the articles in this wiki constitute both explanation and advice, they will occasionally slip into first-person speech. At the present time, the only author is [Justin Searls](http://twitter.com/searls), so any references to "Me", "I", etc., refer to him. If, down the road, others contribute to this wiki, then first-person voice should be read as a consensus of their opinions unless otherwise noted.
