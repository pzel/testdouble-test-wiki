(Training exercise)

We're going to use [Cucumber](http://cukes.info) to test-drive the famous [Bank OCR kata](http://www.codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataBankOCR). We chose Cucumber, because Gherkin is a great fit for embedding large, unwieldy blocks of text like the ASCII representations of each number.
