Test-driven development is a collection of practices typified by writing new production code by first writing a failing test that demands the code into existence. Its proponents point to values that range from reducing defects to improving code design. Oft-cited ancillary benefits point to improved productivity via increased focus, tighter [feedback loops](http://blog.rescuetime.com/2012/08/22/feedback-loops-your-secret-weapon-for-productivity-in-the-workplace/), and lessening the impulse to [future-proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it) solutions.

The TDD label has been used in dozens of contexts and claimed by hundreds of practitioners, so there are a number of varying opinions as to what TDD is and isn't. This wiki discusses a few of them (in, admittedly, very broad strokes):

* "Classical" or [[Detroit-school TDD]]
* "Mockist" or [[London-school TDD]]
* [[Discovery Testing]], an iteration on ideas from [[London-school|London-school TDD]]
