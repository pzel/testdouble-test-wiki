Have you read [GOOS](http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com)? This is basically GOOS.

## The Name

This school of TDD was derived from years of practice in the Extreme Programming community in London. It describes an entirely different approach to test-driven development from its predecessor, the more prevalent [[Detroit-school|Detroit-school TDD]]. Many of the concepts were first published (to my knowledge) in a [paper at XP 2000](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/research/demeter/related-work/extreme-programming/MockObjectsFinal.PDF). 

I can't speak for the GOOS's authors, [Nat Pryce](http://www.natpryce.com) and [Steve Freeman](http://higherorderlogic.com), so this article and other descriptions of "London" TDD only represent my derivative iterations on the concepts and themes they first published in their book.
