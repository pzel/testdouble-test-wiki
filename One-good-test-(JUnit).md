For this exercise, we'll attempt to use JUnit to test-drive the [[Greeting Kata]] to get a feel for what an expressive test looks like in JUnit. 

In this activity, we'll:

1. Start with a live code demonstration
2. Discuss as a group some design tensions when writing JUnit tests
3. Breakout to attempt the Kata individually
4. Present a novel aspect of our approach or solution
