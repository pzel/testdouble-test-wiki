(Training Exercise)

For this exercise, we'll work as a [mob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming) and test-drive the [[Greeting Kata]] to get a feel for what an expressive test looks like in various testing frameworks. 

In this activity, we'll:

1. Start with a live code demonstration of the first requirement or two by the instructor
2. For each additional requirement we implement, cycle in a new driver to the keyboard
3. Throughout, but especially during the refactor step, solicit and offer feedback to one another ([nitpicks](http://help.exercism.io/nitpicking-code.html) are encouraged)
4. Hold a mini-retrospective contrasting the exercise to our previous experiences

## Conversations

Even a simple test like this one can raise a lot of meaningful conversations. Some topics that may come up:

* [[Arrange / Act / Assert]] 
* [[Necessary & Sufficient]] 
* [[Meaningless Test Data]] 
* [[One line => One action]] 
* [[DRY in Testing]] 
* [[Healthy Assertions]]
