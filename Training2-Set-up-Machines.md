Attendees of this course may use either Java & Eclipse or C# & Visual Studio. Depending on the language you want to use, the tools you'll want to install will vary.

## Java

### Source code

There are two preconfigured projects that we will work from: one for unit tests and one for browser tests. Pull down both and verify they work on your machine by following the instructions in their README files:

* [a simple JUnit project](https://github.com/testdouble/java-junit-example) 
* [a Cucumber and Selenium project](https://github.com/testdouble/java-cucumber-example)

### IDE Plugins

There are a couple IDE plugins that we will use to reduce the amount of friction when running tests inside Eclipse.

* [MoreUnit](http://moreunit.sourceforge.net/#download)
* [EclEmma](http://www.eclemma.org/installation.html)

If either plugin's update site is inaccessible, download the source and manually install the plugin by placing the expanded plugin into the `dropins` folder in your Eclipse installation directory and then restarting Eclipse.

Verify MoreUnit is installed by right-clicking anywhere in a Java source listing and verifying a "MoreUnit" item appears in the context menu.

Verify EclEmma is installed by right-clicking a JUnit test and seeing a "Coverage As…" item in the context menu.

### IDE Settings

#### Download source & docs

By default, Eclipse will only fetch compiled dependencies, but not the source attachments or JavaDoc. Doing so adds little overhead and allows you to navigate to and read the code you depend on with a simple ctrl-click. Just visit `Preferences` -> `Maven` and checking `Download Artifact Sources` and `Download Artifact JavaDoc`

#### Wildcard static imports

In order to clear warnings, it's common to use the "Organize imports" command (ctrl-shift-o), but it has the side effect of creating an explicit import statement for every static import, clearing out any wildcards. This has the side effect of making [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) libraries like Hamcrest harder to use.

To change the behavior of organize imports to wildcard static imports more aggressively, visit  `Java` -> `Code Style` -> `Organize Imports` and change "Number of static imports needed for .*" to `1`

#### Organize packages hierarchically

When creating a lot of classes, it's easier to organize them into well-considered package hierarchies, but by default Eclipse will list them all out in a flat view that makes it harder to navigate. To display them hierarchically, click the Project Explorer pane's downward-facing triangle, and selecting `Package Presentation` -> `Hierarchical`:

#### Organize projects hierarchically

When working on a multi-project Maven module or a working set, you can group those projects together in Eclipse's Project Explorer by clicking the downward-facing triangle, and selecting `Projects Presentation` -> `Hierarchical`:
