_This is a pre-survey for a multi-day training from [Test Double](http://testdouble.com). [Contact us](mailto:hello+training@testdouble.com) if you'd like more information._

Welcome! To get things started off, everyone please take four index cards and a marker. In large print, answer these questions (each on their own card):

1. What's something you know about testing?
2. What are you most excited about this week? (If anything at all)
3. What's something you want to learn about testing?
4. What are you most worried about this week?
5. Are you already comfortable with git, GitHub, forking projects, and pull requests? (It's OK to answer "No"!)

Once everyone is present and fills their cards, we'll circle up and present our cards to each other and discuss our hopes and fears for the week. I'll do my very best to be mindful of both, and also make a point that everything people want to learn is addressed.

While you're waiting for your colleagues, clone this [sample project repo](https://github.com/searls/java-testing-example), which we'll use for the next couple days. If you find yourself with extra time waiting, feel free to double-check that you can get it running.
