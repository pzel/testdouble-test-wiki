Concepts:
* Trusting [Eclipse's Refactoring Support](http://help.eclipse.org/juno/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2Fconcepts%2Fconcept-refactoring.htm) to help us find a testable "Seam" in the code
* [Sunk-cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment)
* "Respond to pain by changing the source code, not masking the pain in the test or with testing tools"
* "Never trust a test you haven't seen fail"
* [Primitive Obsession](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrimitiveObsession)
* [Sandi Metz](http://www.sandimetz.com)'s Squint Test: changes in shape indicate high complexity (loops and branching), while changes in color suggest the code operates at multiple levels of abstraction simultaneously
