Redundant coverage is a testing anti-pattern which describes [code coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage) the situation in which the behavior of a particular production code path is depended on by multiple tests.

Redundant coverage is problematic because a single desired change in a given bit of production code might result in a need to change numerous tests, who would otherwise fail (and as a [[false negative|negative analysis]], at that). 

For instance, if a system has a unit `DeterminesAdulthood` which determines if a user is of majority age, and a later requirement changes the age of majority from 18 to 21, then any test which both exercises `DeterminesAdulthood` and cares about whether users are adults may be impacted by the change.

This anti-pattern becomes a systemic problem under very common architectural patterns, such as in a multi-layered web application server like Ruby on Rails. If the above example had been implemented as a predicate method `adult?` on a `User` model, then a typical Rails test suite would be expected to redundantly cover `User#adult?` in `User`'s model test, controller test, and integration test, as well as in the analogous tests of any domain objects which depend on `User` (which in a Rails application, is typically "all of them")

As a point of test design, then, finding a way to minimize redundant code coverage is considered a worthwhile goal. An advantage of [[London-school TDD]] is that its isolation test suites tend to significantly reduce redundant coverage; often, units in such systems are tested exactly twice: in their [[symmetrical unit test]] and in an integrated [[SAFE test]].
